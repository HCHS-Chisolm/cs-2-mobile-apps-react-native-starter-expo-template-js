# Expo Template

This is a template for creating an Expo Project on GitPod or Codespaces.

## To Start

You will need to start by creating your expo app with the following command and answering the questions about your app.

```
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

Next, you will have to `cd` into the new directory created for your app.
Now, start the server using the `npm start web` command.

You should probably find a tutorial and use the Expo and React Native Docs, often. Here is the link to the [Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.dev) where there is a really quick and excellent tutorial of building a photo app if you think that is helpful.

Finally, make sure you commit _constantly_ and _small_.
